    [OpenFGA](https://openfga.dev) is an open source Fine-Grained Authorization solution inspired by [Google's Zanzibar paper](https://research.google/pubs/pub48190/). It was created by the FGA team at [Auth0](https://auth0.com) based on [Auth0 Fine-Grained Authorization (FGA)](https://fga.dev), available under [a permissive license (Apache-2)](https://github.com/openfga/rfcs/blob/main/LICENSE) and welcomes community contributions.

OpenFGA is designed to make it easy for application builders to model their permission layer, and to add and integrate fine-grained authorization into their applications. OpenFGA’s design is optimized for reliability and low latency at a high scale.
